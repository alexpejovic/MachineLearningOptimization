#CSC209 Assignment 3

This program uses a set of classified grayscale images of drawn digits as
input, finds patterns in these images, and then uses that pattern to classify
other grayscale drawings of digits later.

This program's run-time is optimized using forking and piping which splits the
work of the algorithm into multiple processes.
